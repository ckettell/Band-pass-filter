- Music company hoping to build a band pass filter.
 # Filter

- Takes a sound wave and returns a sound wave
- Filter has a upper and lower limit. Filter upper and lower limit
- Upper and lower limit come as parameters. This will be an option in the programme.
- Soundwave is an array of integers. Paramaters are also integers.

# Example
- If given an array of [1, 1, 4, 4] and the lower limit is 2 and upper limit is 3. The expected array will be [2, 2, 3, 3]

# Edge cases
- Sometimes the spftware which produces the soundwave produces null values for the integers. When this happens it should produce the word 'Error'.
